# OpenGL-assignments
These three folders are the results of my computer graphics college course. These assignments each consist of multiple scenes, and the requirements are described in each assignment's respective pdf file. I programmed all these scenes, and learned a heck of a lot of linear algebra along the way. This was while I was studying abroad at the University of Wollongong in Australia!
